## Importance of AMA's and Voice Calls

_The importance of voice calls for explaining cryptocurrency projects is because they provide an interactive way to communicate information. During a voice call, it is easier for the presenter to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of a project, as well as answer questions from the audience in real-time. Additionally, voice calls can help build trust and credibility with potential investors by allowing them to hear the people behind the project and ask questions directly. Overall, voice calls provide a valuable tool for effective communication and understanding of cryptocurrency projects._
