## Development Intelligent Contract - Explanation

_A Smart Contract is a technological tool that consists of a computer program designed to automate the obligations and rules established between two or more parties in a transaction. These contracts are stored and executed on a blockchain, which gives them security, transparency, and immutability. The automation of tasks and transfers of value, which are performed independently when previously established conditions are met, make smart contracts an efficient solution that eliminates the need for intermediaries._\
