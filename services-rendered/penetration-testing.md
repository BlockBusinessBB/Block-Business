# Penetraion Testing

## _<mark style="color:blue;">Penetration Testing of Modern Applications</mark>_

_Our penetration testing services uncover even the slightest weaknesses using proprietary tools powered by an experienced team of ethical hackers._

_Our continuous penetration testing process follows 6 key stages of discovery, testing, reporting of findings, and retesting after corrections are made._

1. _**Plan:** Determine the application to be tested and set the frequency of testing._
2. _**Scope**: Clarify the extent and objective of testing the application, including the chosen testing methodology such as white-box, grey-box, or black-box._
3. _**Test**: Conduct a scan of the network and application to identify hosts and services. Perform attack and exploitation tests on both the network and application._
4. _**Report:** Disseminate the findings and outcomes obtained during the test, including remediation suggestions to rectify the identified vulnerabilities._
5. _**Rectification:** Collaborate effectively with your rectification team to rectify or minimize the identified vulnerabilities._
6. _**Retest:** Verify the rectifications made, enhance your penetration testing program over time, and ensure continuous coverage through further testing._
